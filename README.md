# Adobe Illustrator Script

Some of script I copy-pasted and/or modified from many publicly/unlicensed scripts on Stack Overflow, Adobe Community Forum and the power of Google Search.

*disclaimer: I'm a designer, not a programmer. So the code might "wrong", but I've tested and it definitely works :)*

## Scripts

### LayerRename-AddPrefix.jsx
**Add Prefix to Layer Name** -- Tested on Adobe Illustrator 2019 -- Batch adding prefix to all visible layers in active document (invisible layer will not affected). Prefix is assigned from input box that appear when executing script.
