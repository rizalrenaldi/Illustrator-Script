# Adobe Illustrator Script

Some of script I copy-pasted and/or modified from many publicly/unlicensed scripts on Stack Overflow, Adobe Community Forum and the power of Google Search. This is also the way I'm learning javascript at the same time.

*Disclaimer: I'm a designer, not a programmer. So the code might "wrong", but I've tested and it definitely works :) Open for correction and please do submit PR if you want to fix it.*

## Scripts

### LayerRename-AddPrefix.jsx
**Add Prefix to Layer Name** -- Tested on Adobe Illustrator 2019 -- Batch adding prefix to all visible layers in active document (invisible layer will not affected). Prefix is assigned from input box that appear when executing script.

### LayerRename-AddPrefix-function.jsx
**Add Prefix to Layer Name** -- Works exactly the same as LayerRename-AddPrefix, but this one wrapped in function. Much more correctly structurized in programming point of view?

### ArtboardRename-AddPrefix.jsx
**Add Prefix to Layer Name** -- Tested on Adobe Illustrator 2019 -- Same as LayerRename-AddPrefix but for artboard.
